# Martee Micromachine Vending Machine Data Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of vending machine data for a Martee Micromachine located in Greenwich Expressway. The analysis is performed using a Jupyter Notebook, and the repository includes all necessary dependencies and the dataset.

## Contents

- `requirements.txt`: A file listing all the dependencies needed to run the analysis.
- `expressway_historical.csv`: The dataset containing vending machine data.
- `martee_working.ipynb`: A Jupyter Notebook with the analysis of the vending machine data.
